# safe_space

Where you go, what you do, how you spend your money, shouldn't be a source of concern regarding your mental/physical safety. The color of your skin, the pronouns you choose to use, or the people you love shouldn't cause you concerns in that regard either.

Unfortunately, not everyone will respect that and not every place you could go will see you in a friendly/supportive light.

The **_Safe Space_** project was meant to help address that. The online resource was being designed using **_Python_**, **_Flask_**, and **_MySQL_**, to allow visitors/users to give feedback on locations and businesses in their area and where they fall along the spectrum of risky and unsupportive, to safe and fully vested in providing an open space. In the inverse it was also meant to let marginalized individuals find places near them that they could frequent and not worry about how they might be perceived.

Ideally, the project was to utilize **Apple's _MapKit JS_** to provide mapping, pins, and geographic searches through the site's public interface.
